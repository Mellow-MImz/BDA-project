# BDA-project

The entire.py file will:
  - assist in creating the labels text file and creating the training and testing splits for both the images and the annots file respectively.
  - This file will also do the resizing of images
  - In the Name function the number of iterations for the for loop will determine how many classes get choosen for whatever you want to do
  - I have added some comments on what each method does but NB!!! change the directories variables relatively to where the files are
  
- I was using the dataset from this link: http://vision.stanford.edu/aditya86/ImageNetDogs/
- I followed the tutorial on: https://pjreddie.com/darknet/yolo/
