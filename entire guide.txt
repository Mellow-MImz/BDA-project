Creating the environment:
	3) conda create -n send pip python=3.6
	4) y
	5) source activate send
	7) To get out: source deactive
Installations:
- conda install tensorflow
- conda install -c menpo opencv3
- conda install cython

following this tutorial: https://pjreddie.com/darknet/yolo/
	- Use weights found in email sent to myself on the Wed, 3 Oct
	- use yolov2.cfg as it shows output and not yolov3.cfg
	
Prep for training:
- Using the file entire.py
	Follow the steps written below to create the necessary files
	Note: change the file directories respectively
	
NB: COPY ACROSS IMAGE.C FILE IN SRC FOLDER FROM THE RETRY FOLDER
then change the directory which the bounding box file wil be stored
- search 'FILE'
	
- Create a .data file contating the following:
	  1 classes= 20
	  2 train  = <path-to-voc>/train.txt
	  3 valid  = <path-to-voc>2007_test.txt
	  4 names = data/voc.names
	  5 backup = backup
	  The two txt files refer to the ones created in point 1
- Download the trained weights from https://pjreddie.com/media/files/darknet53.conv.74

To train:
- Run: ./darknet detector train me/sub_data.data cfg/yolov3-voc.cfg darknet53.conv.74

- check out this site for similar cnn frameworks to use: https://pjreddie.com/darknet/imagenet/
- Test using: ./darknet detect cfg/yolov2.cfg bin/yolo.weights data/dingo_630.jpg
